The Open Compute Project’s “Open System Firmware” branch aims to replace the early-stage, proprietary hardware initialisation code with peer-reviewed, secure and tested open source code. This talk will be a whirlwind overview of how modern X86-based hardware boots, how Open System Firmware works, it’s advantages, and how people can try it out. John Looney is a Production Engineer in Facebook, whose team is replacing proprietary firmware on millions of servers and switches with open system firmware.'
